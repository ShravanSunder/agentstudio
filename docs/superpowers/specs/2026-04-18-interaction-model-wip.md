# Interaction Model — WIP

**Status:** Work in progress · Design thinking, not yet a decision
**Date:** 2026-04-18
**Related:** [Notification Inbox Spec](2026-04-17-notification-inbox-design.md)
**Scope:** clarifies "layer" vs "focus-scoped keys" across sidebar, inbox, management layer, CommandBar. Introduces `KeyboardOwner` as a derived abstraction for naming who owns keyboard interpretation at any moment. Captures the separation-of-concerns discussion before it gets baked into individual feature specs.

---

## 1. The insight hiding in plain sight

Management Layer is unique for a reason that's easy to miss. It's not just "a layer." It's a specific *kind* of keyboard modality that earns the name because of what it does to the app, not because of what sidebar it happens to touch.

```
┌─ What makes a "Layer" a Layer ──────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│  • Visual disruption         — chrome changes, not subtle       │
│  • User-triggered            — explicit gesture, not derived    │
│  • Reinterprets normal keys  — keys that mean X now mean Y      │
│  • Global / modal            — affects the whole workspace      │
│  • Has a clear exit gesture  — you know how to leave            │
│                                                                 │
│  Today: ManagementLayer ✓ (all five boxes)                      │
│  CommandBar: ✓ mostly — it's a key window, not quite a layer    │
│  Inbox navigation: ✗ fails 3 of 5                               │
│  Repos navigation: ✗ fails 4 of 5                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Sidebar surfaces (inbox, repos) don't earn Layer status. Calling them layers makes users wonder what "mode" they're in, when the honest answer is "none — you're just using the sidebar."

## 2. Three kinds of keyboard modality in the app

There are three — not one pattern applied repeatedly. Naming them keeps the model honest.

```
┌─ Kind 1: LAYERS (rare, explicit, modal) ────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│  Global state shift. User toggles. Chrome changes dramatically. │
│  Same keys mean different things.                               │
│                                                                 │
│  Today:    ManagementLayer                                      │
│  Storage:  @Observable atom with isActive: Bool                 │
│  Monitor:  ManagementLayerMonitor                               │
│  Signal:   Strong chrome change (pane dim, panel transform)     │
│                                                                 │
│  Rule: add a new Layer only if all 5 criteria from §1 are met.  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ Kind 2: KEY WINDOW (temporary, focus-grabbing) ────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│  AppKit concept. A window becomes key; it gets all key events.  │
│  Built-in mechanism. Not state we manage.                       │
│                                                                 │
│  Today:    CommandBar panel                                     │
│  Storage:  NSWindow.isKeyWindow (AppKit owns it)                │
│  Monitor:  performKeyEquivalent on the panel                    │
│  Signal:   The panel is visible and focused. Obvious.           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ Kind 3: FOCUS-SCOPED KEYS (common, derived, local) ────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│  Custom keys that only make sense when a particular surface     │
│  has focus. Active = (surface visible) AND (surface has focus). │
│  No stored "mode" — keys just work or don't based on focus.     │
│                                                                 │
│  Today:    Filter field in sidebar (⌘F via .filterSidebar)      │
│  Storage:  None (derived from @FocusState + visibility)         │
│  Monitor:  SwiftUI .keyboardShortcut() in view hierarchy, OR a  │
│            local NSViewRepresentable key monitor guarded by     │
│            @FocusState                                          │
│  Signal:   The surface is visible + has native focus ring       │
│                                                                 │
│  This is what Inbox and Repos navigation actually are.          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Kind 3 dispatches natively through SwiftUI `.keyboardShortcut()` and the AppKit responder chain. No central router is required for Kind 3 to function. However, there IS a first-class concept that names WHICH of these three modalities owns keys at any moment: `KeyboardOwner` (see §4). That concept is a derived abstraction consumed by CommandBar scope defaulting, debug/observability, and future unified dispatch — not a prerequisite for Kind 3 shortcuts to fire.

## 3. Separation of concerns

```

Six concerns. Five of them are either existing or are modest additions to existing atoms. One (`KeyboardOwner`) is a derived abstraction — a value type produced by a stateless factory, never stored.

### `WorkspaceFocus` stays pure

`WorkspaceFocus` is a snapshot used exclusively for command visibility (`CommandSpec.satisfiedRequirements.isSubset(of:)` at `Core/State/MainActor/Atoms/WorkspaceFocus.swift`). Zero keyboard-routing uses today. Keep it that way — extending it with keyboard ownership corrupts the pattern and turns a snapshot into a mode router.

It MAY grow additive, pure-visibility fields (e.g., `sidebarSurface: .repos | .inbox | .none`) if a concrete `CommandSpec.isVisible` use case needs it. It MUST NOT grow keyboard-ownership semantics. Keyboard ownership lives in `KeyboardOwner` (§4), not in `WorkspaceFocus`.

## 4. `KeyboardOwner` — the derived abstraction

A derived, runtime-computed concept that names who owns keyboard interpretation at a given moment. It is:

- **NOT a layer** — layers are Kind 1 (see §2). Only `ManagementLayer` qualifies today.
- **NOT WorkspaceFocus** — different question (see §4.1).
- **NOT manually toggled or persisted.**
- A pure function over atom state, mirroring the `WorkspaceFocusDerived` pattern.

### 4.1 Why it is NOT WorkspaceFocus — explicit comparison

│  Orthogonal. Both can be active simultaneously.                 │
│  Example:                                                       │
│    WorkspaceFocus: terminal pane in repo X on tab Y             │
│    KeyboardOwner:  .otherWindow (user opened ⌘P)                │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

They share a pattern (derived snapshot) but not a concept. One does not subsume the other.

### 4.2 Why it deserves its own abstraction (not just vocabulary)

│  1. It has an identity                                        │

│  2. It has meaningful transitions                             │
│     Sidebar gains focus → owner changes. Management layer     │

│  3. Its logic is centralized or it's duplicated               │

│  4. It mirrors an existing, working pattern                   │

```

### 4.3 Shape

```swift
/// Who owns keyboard interpretation at a given moment.
/// Derived. Never stored. Never manually set.
enum KeyboardOwner: Equatable, Sendable {

    /// Some other window is key (CommandBar panel, sheet, alert).
    /// AppKit routes keys there; the workspace is passive.
    case otherWindow

    /// Management Layer is active. Its monitor interprets keys.
    case managementLayer

    /// Sidebar is visible, has responder focus, and is showing
    /// a surface. The surface's local shortcuts are live.
    case sidebar(SidebarSurface)

    /// Main window is key and nothing above applies.
    /// Responder chain handles keys normally (pane content, etc.).
    case none
}

/// Stateless factory; mirrors WorkspaceFocusDerived.
@MainActor
struct KeyboardOwnerDerived {
    func current(
        windowLifecycle: WindowLifecycleAtom,
        managementLayer: ManagementLayerAtom,
        uiState: UIStateAtom
    ) -> KeyboardOwner {

        //  1. Workspace window must be key. Otherwise some other
        //     window (CommandBar panel, sheet, alert) has focus.
        guard windowLifecycle.isWorkspaceWindowKey else {
            return .otherWindow
        }

        //  2. Management Layer preempts sidebar ownership.
        if managementLayer.isActive {
            return .managementLayer
        }

        //  3. Sidebar owns keys if it is visible AND focused.
        if !uiState.sidebarCollapsed && uiState.sidebarHasFocus {
            return .sidebar(uiState.sidebarSurface)
        }

        //  4. Otherwise: responder chain handles keys normally.
        return .none
    }
}
```

`WindowLifecycleAtom.isWorkspaceWindowKey` is a computed read over existing state:

```swift
var isWorkspaceWindowKey: Bool {
    keyWindowId.map { registeredWindowIds.contains($0) } ?? false
}
```

The atom already tracks `keyWindowId` and `registeredWindowIds` today (see `Core/State/MainActor/Atoms/WindowLifecycleAtom.swift`) — this is a one-line accessor, not new storage.

### 4.4 Inputs: AppKit state published to atoms (the γ pattern)

Every input `KeyboardOwnerDerived` reads is atom-sourced. AppKit runtime facts are published into atoms via monitors — the existing pattern for AppKit ingress in this codebase (`ApplicationLifecycleMonitor`, `WindowLifecycleAtom`).

```
┌─ AppKit → monitor → atom → derived reader ─────────────────────┐
│                                                                │

│  NSWindow.didBecomeKey   ApplicationLife    WindowLifecycle    │
│  NSWindow.didResignKey   cycleMonitor       Atom               │

│                                                                │

│  Then KeyboardOwnerDerived reads only atoms — zero AppKit      │
│  in the function, zero new seam patterns.                      │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This is **coherent with the existing architecture**. `CLAUDE.md` explicitly describes `ApplicationLifecycleMonitor` as "ingress-only and mutates lifecycle stores directly from AppKit callbacks." We are extending that pattern, not inventing a new one.

**Reactivity for free.** Consumers observing `uiState` or `windowLifecycle` via `@Observable` re-evaluate `KeyboardOwnerDerived.current(...)` naturally during SwiftUI view body evaluation. No special observation wiring. CommandBar scope defaulting becomes a one-line read during body evaluation.

**Testability for free.** Tests set atom state directly (`uiState.setSidebarHasFocus(true)`) and assert on `KeyboardOwnerDerived.current(...)`. No AppKit fakes required.

### 4.5 Placement

`Core/State/MainActor/Atoms/KeyboardOwnerDerived.swift`

Mirrors `WorkspaceFocusDerived.swift` at the same location. Core because multiple features (CommandBar, Inbox, RepoExplorer, ManagementLayer observers) read it.

### 4.6 Implementation timing

**Designed now (this doc). Implemented later (when the first cross-feature consumer emerges).**

LUNA-361 inbox work does not land the type in code. The inbox's custom shortcuts (⌥F, ⌥G, ⌥S, etc.) fire natively via SwiftUI `.keyboardShortcut()` + AppKit responder chain; they do not call `KeyboardOwnerDerived`.

The first cross-feature consumer is expected to be either:

1. **CommandBar scope defaulting** — "when user opens ⌘P, pick default scope based on current keyboard owner." Today CommandBar uses `.everything`; owner-aware defaults are a natural next step.
2. **Repos navigation keymap** — when repos sidebar gains arrow-key navigation, it benefits from the same derived reader (symmetric with inbox).

Whichever consumer arrives first implements the enum, the factory, and the one-line `isWorkspaceWindowKey` accessor on `WindowLifecycleAtom`, plus publishes `sidebarHasFocus` from the root sidebar view. Because this doc commits the shape, file path, and precedence, that implementer does not re-design.

### 4.7 Consumers (documented intent)

1. **Vocabulary in specs/docs.** Specs refer to "owner" when talking about keyboard state, grounded in a real type.
2. **CommandBar scope defaulting.** `isVisible: owner == .sidebar(.inbox)` → show inbox-scoped commands by default.
3. **Debug / observability.** Log owner on keystrokes in debug builds.
4. **Future unified dispatcher.** If the three parallel interception mechanisms (key window, management monitor, responder chain) are unified into a `KeyboardDispatcher`, owner is its switch value.
5. **Tests.** Assert owner in a readable way: `#expect(owner == .sidebar(.inbox))`.

## 5. Shortcut resolution pipeline

                  (⌘I, ⌘S, ⌘T, ⌘P, ⌘W, etc.)
```

Each interception point corresponds to a `KeyboardOwner` case:
- Key window intercept → `.otherWindow`
- Management layer monitor → `.managementLayer`
- Responder chain, focus in sidebar → `.sidebar(surface)`
- Responder chain, focus elsewhere → `.none`

Global shortcuts are orthogonal to ownership. `KeyboardOwner` doesn't CHANGE dispatch — it NAMES what's happening.

**Inbox and repos custom keys (⌥F/⌥G/⌥S etc.) fit inside #3**, not as new mechanisms. They're standard responder-chain shortcuts that happen to be attached to views in the sidebar hierarchy. No new interception mechanism is added.

### Deferred architectural debt

Today the three interception points are parallel mechanisms (no unified dispatcher). As sidebar surfaces grow (inbox now, richer repos nav later), the responder-chain branch of this pipeline accumulates more `.keyboardShortcut()` attachments. That's fine for now. A future refactor could introduce a `KeyboardDispatcher` that switches on `KeyboardOwner` and replaces the parallel monitors with a single table-driven dispatch. Out of scope for LUNA-361; flagged.

```

The "how will users know what layer they're on" concern dissolves when we stop calling sidebar surfaces layers. Visual signals for `.sidebar(...)` are already present:

- Sidebar is visibly showing this surface
- Sidebar has a visible focus ring / selection highlight

That's enough. No "INBOX MODE" badge. No confusion about modes because there is no mode — the user is using the sidebar, and the sidebar has focus.

Management Layer keeps its strong chrome change because it *is* modal and has earned the ceremony.

## 8. Surface selection — where does `sidebarSurface` live?

Feature atoms own their domain (clean). Surface selection (which view is currently showing in the sidebar) is a separate concern. Three options were considered:

```
┌─ Option A: each feature atom has `isShownInSidebar` flag ──────┐
│                                                                │

│                                                                │
│  PRO: fully feature-isolated                                   │
│  CON: two booleans that MUST be mutually exclusive —           │

│                                                                │
│  PRO: UIStateAtom already holds "view state"                   │
│       (expanded groups, colors, filter state) —                │
│       surface selection is a peer concept.                     │
│  PRO: one source of truth, type enforces mutex.                │

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ Option C: surface in a controller, not an atom ───────────────┐
│                                                                │
│  MainSplitViewController.currentSidebarSurface: SidebarSurface │
│                                                                │
│  PRO: "which view is showing" is naturally a controller concern│
│  CON: SwiftUI views reading an AppKit controller property      │
│       needs a seam (@Observable wrapper or env object)         │
│  CON: KeyboardOwnerDerived must then read from the controller, │
│       breaking the "reads only atoms" property                 │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Chosen: Option B.** Reasons:

1. Type-enforced mutex. An enum makes "only one surface active" a compile-time guarantee.
2. `UIStateAtom` already holds view preferences of exactly this shape.
3. Feature atoms stay pure. `NotificationInboxAtom` knows nothing about "am I showing?" — it just holds notifications.
4. CommandBar scope gating is trivial: `isVisible: uiState.sidebarSurface == .inbox`.
5. Free persistence via existing `UIStateStore` (for `sidebarSurface` — `sidebarHasFocus` is runtime-only, not persisted).
6. Preserves the "KeyboardOwnerDerived reads only atoms" property (rules out Option C).

### Persistence note

- `sidebarSurface` — persisted in `UIStateStore`. User's last surface survives relaunch.
- `sidebarHasFocus` — NOT persisted. Runtime-only. Reset to false on launch (the sidebar doesn't auto-focus at startup).

## 9. Feature atoms — the growth picture

Feature slices for sidebar surfaces will grow. Worth checking forward compatibility.

### How UIStateAtom's surface tag grows

```
v1 (inbox lands)
  sidebarSurface: .repos | .inbox

v2 (settings sidebar lands)
  sidebarSurface: .repos | .inbox | .settings

v3 (search sidebar lands)
  sidebarSurface: .repos | .inbox | .settings | .search

Each new surface adds one enum case.
UIStateAtom doesn't know what BACKS that surface (which feature
atom, which view) — it just holds the tag.
`KeyboardOwner.sidebar(SidebarSurface)` grows the same way.
```

### What growth does NOT change

- Surface selection stays on `UIStateAtom` as a thin enum.
- Feature atoms stay feature-scoped — they don't leak knowledge of sidebar presentation.
- Collections, pins, search — all land in `Features/RepoExplorer/State/`.
- ⌘S's composite command may take arguments (e.g., a collection id) — that's a command-plane concern, not an atom-placement concern.

## 11. Open questions / TBD

- **Unify keyboard dispatch?** Currently three parallel mechanisms (key window, management layer monitor, responder chain). The responder-chain branch accumulates more `.keyboardShortcut()` attachments as sidebar surfaces grow. Out of scope for LUNA-361; flagged as accumulating debt. `KeyboardOwner` is the switch value for such a dispatcher if we build one.
- **When does focus auto-move into the sidebar?** ⌘I moves focus to the inbox list (first row). ⌘S does NOT force focus — user may be typing filter into repos. Validate against real usage.
- **`WorkspaceFocus.sidebarSurface` (pure-visibility)?** Only add if a concrete `CommandSpec` needs it. Do not proactively extend.
- **How do multiple sidebars interact with split panes?** Not addressed — currently sidebar is window-level. If per-pane sidebars appear, surface state may need to move to a different atom.
- **Does `.otherWindow` need sub-cases?** Flat for v1 (no consumer distinguishes CommandBar from sheet from alert). Refine if a use case appears.

## 12. Next steps

1. Land this doc as WIP. Iterate.
2. Revise [`2026-04-17-notification-inbox-design.md`](2026-04-17-notification-inbox-design.md):
    - Drop `NotificationInboxLayerAtom`
    - Adopt `UIStateAtom.sidebarSurface` and `UIStateAtom.sidebarHasFocus`
    - ⌘I / ⌘S as composite commands
    - Reference `KeyboardOwner` as the naming concept (no code dependency)
    - Refactor §5 accordingly
3. Implement `KeyboardOwnerDerived` when the first cross-feature consumer arrives (probably CommandBar scope defaulting or repos sidebar navigation).
4. When ideas here solidify across real consumers, promote to `docs/architecture/interaction_model.md` (non-WIP).
5. Reference this doc from future specs that introduce new sidebar surfaces or keyboard semantics.
