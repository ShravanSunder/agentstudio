# Agent IPC v2 and Agent Package — User Requirements (draft)

Date: 2026-09-12. Extracted in a pathfinding session with the product owner on
branch `ipc-improvements`. Authority state is per row; only `authorized` rows
are normative-eligible for `spec-design`. Decisions and their rationale live
in [decision-record.md](decision-record.md).

Status: **goal boundary confirmed by the owner on 2026-09-12** ("ok lets go
through orchestrate design"), with the amendments in decision-record.md J
(Swift-owned, JSON-RPC schema, CLI now / Rust CLI later), K (spool as the
collector; no message lost across restart is a must), and AA (normal IDE
startup, fresh terminal creation, and existing-zmx attachment never wait for
IPC communication, credential persistence, or spool readiness), as refined by
AB (retained-shell Undo eligibility restoration and the explicit failure window for
credentials that never become durable), as corrected by AC (restoration keeps
the existing zmx shell and token; it does not issue a replacement credential).

## Who this is for

| Class | Distinguishing behavior | Outcome that matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C1 Developer running agents in Agent Studio panes | starts several Claude/Codex/Cursor turns, leaves panes, returns later | knows what each agent is doing and when one needs them, without visiting every pane |
| C2 Agent running inside a pane (downstream agent consumer of the CLI/skill) | executes a skill; can only read its environment and run a CLI | can identify its pane, open files in the app, report status, send messages, with a herdr-simple DX |
| C3 Provider package installer/operator | installs and upgrades the Agent Studio agent package on a machine | one install registers the right native hooks/skills/plugins per provider without hand-editing config |
| C4 Agent Studio maintainers | keep `AppCommand`/`ipcSpec` exhaustive and the IPC boundary lint-clean | IPC v2 does not create a second command catalog or leak renderer/daemon internals |
| S1 Future ACP / codex-router integration (stakeholder, no journey) | later slices connect ACP-hosted agents and agent-to-agent messaging | this slice's contracts remain additive for them |

Out of scope (deliberately): users of the retired Inbox; users of other
terminals not running Agent Studio; remote/multi-machine operators.

## Evidence anchors used by the rows

- E-IPC: this repo's IPC census, refreshed at `3ea043ab3` on 2026-09-15 —
  a normal pane shell receives no Agent Studio identity; fresh terminal creation
  and existing-zmx attachment call no `PaneIPCIdentityOwner`; the identity owner
  and Sessions runtime have no production object consumer. Sessions/IPC schema
  migrations are nevertheless registered in pre-window local database
  preparation, and AppIPC filesystem/socket/catalog setup runs synchronously
  after window presentation but before post-presentation boot continues.
- E-HERDR: herdr @ a5d5f6f6 — `HERDR_ENV`/`HERDR_PANE_ID`/`HERDR_SOCKET_PATH`
  injection, `skills/herdr/SKILL.md` guardrail, per-source seq and session
  fencing in `src/terminal/state.rs`, one status authority per pane.
- E-ORCA / E-GHOSTEX: orca hook scripts POST hook stdin JSON to a persisted
  local endpoint; `orca file open` resolves cwd → worktree; Ghostex
  `gxserver/src/agent-hooks.ts:58-153` writes native hook files for 12 CLIs.
- E-HOOKS: Claude Code hooks reference (Notification matchers, Stop,
  SubagentStop, `session_id`/`transcript_path`/`cwd`); Cursor hooks reference
  (no idle/permission event; `afterAgentResponse`, `stop`; CLI applicability
  undocumented beyond `workspaceOpen`); Codex `hooks.json`, legacy `notify`,
  `[tui] notification_method = "osc9"`; pi extension API; OpenCode plugin
  events and herdr's OpenCode plugin mapping.
- E-SPEC: 2026-08-03 Agent Sessions family (latest authority, design-only) and
  2026-08-21 Inbox Retirement (shipped structurally: Inbox boot functions have
  zero callers, all Inbox commands `.notPresented` / `.notExposed`).
- E-OWNER: owner statements in this session (quoted in the decision record).

## Rows

| ID | Class | Need or outcome | Evidence | Authority | Priority | Assigner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U1 | C2 | Every ordinary genuinely new pane shell gets the environment identity needed to identify its pane/workspace and reach Agent Studio (ids, socket path, pane-scoped token). Restoration reattaches to the existing zmx shell, which keeps its original environment and token; it does not require credential replacement. A bounded identity creation or authority-registration failure is reported as unavailable and never prevents the pane shell itself from starting. | E-IPC (nothing injected today), E-HERDR, E-OWNER (A, AA, AC) | authorized | must | owner |
| U2 | C2, C1 | An agent can open a file (path, line) in Agent Studio placed relative to its own pane — default the caller's drawer — instead of printing a link. **This slice designs only the IPC contract at the boundary (method, params, results, errors) as a reserved, unadvertised contract; the internals are a separate later piece of work (decisions P, V).** | E-IPC (no `file.*` method; `showViewer` unexposed), E-ORCA, E-OWNER (C, P, V) | authorized (contract only) | must (contract) / deferred (internals) | owner |
| U3 | C2 | An agent can drive Agent Studio through a curated, agent-friendly semantic API plus generic headless command execution; UI-interactive verbs are not exposed in stable/beta. In DEBUG mode the full command spec — every `AppCommand`, with explicit typed arguments — is callable from IPC with good DX (decision Z). | E-IPC (83 verbs rejected today), E-OWNER (B, S, Z) | authorized | must | owner |
| U23 | C2 (test agents), C4 | Running and controlling a debug app is zero-ceremony: a small model (Haiku/Luna class) given only the skill can discover the running debug app and drive it — no tokens, socket paths, or flags to assemble; repeated CLI calls authenticate without manual steps. | E-OWNER (Y) | authorized | must | owner |
| U4 | C2, C4 | Every exposed IPC argument contract is redesigned to be agent-friendly; the current phase-1 shapes are not carried forward as-is. | E-IPC (zero argument-bearing commands executable), E-OWNER (B) | authorized | must | owner |
| U5 | C3 | One installable Agent Studio package registers, per provider, the provider's native hooks / skill / plugin using that provider's own lifecycle. Round 1: Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor CLI. | E-GHOSTEX, E-HOOKS, E-OWNER (D1, D2) | authorized | must | owner |
| U6 | C3 | Round 2 adds pi and OpenCode through the same package. | E-HOOKS, E-OWNER (D1) | authorized | should | owner |
| U7 | C1 | Agent Studio learns each agent's lifecycle from provider-native events: session start/end, turn start/done, needs-you (permission, question, elicitation), tool use, subagent activity. | E-HOOKS, E-OWNER (D3) | authorized | must | owner |
| U8 | C2, C1 | An agent can send any message to Agent Studio; the message is stored durably and visible in Sessions. | E-OWNER (D4) | authorized | must | owner |
| U9 | C1 | Message text is never exported to OTLP/JSONL telemetry. | E-OWNER (D4), existing scrub rule in CLAUDE.md | authorized | must | owner |
| U10 | C1 | macOS notification banners for agent messages/attention can be enabled later. | E-OWNER (D4) | authorized | could | owner |
| U11 | C1 | Agent Studio can talk to the agent in a pane (bidirectional), so the user can steer agents programmatically. **Deferred to round 2 / PR2 by decision N (2026-09-13); not part of this slice.** | E-OWNER (I, N) | authorized (deferred) | should | owner |
| U12 | C1 | Status honesty: each fact carries whether the provider reported it, the agent asserted it, or it was estimated; typed terminal signals (OSC 9, title, progress) count as provider-authored; screen manifests are not used in this slice. | E-SPEC (08-03 labels), E-HOOKS (Codex OSC 9), E-OWNER (E) | authorized | must | owner |
| U13 | C1 | Needs-you is observed and shown in this slice; each needs-you carries a request id so answering from Agent Studio can be added later without redesign. | E-OWNER (H) | authorized | must | owner |
| U14 | C1 | Sessions state is rebuildable after restart; accepted agent messages and seen/attention state survive restart; agent messages and deliberate agent reports durably spooled while the app is unreachable are never lost (the CLI spools notifications, never commands). A continuing shell whose credential did not become durable before the prior process ended receives explicit IPC failure after relaunch until a new shell is created; authentication rejection never becomes offline spooling. Hook lifecycle state facts emitted while the app is down are not collected in round 1 (decision X). | E-ORCA (spool), E-OWNER (F, K, U, X, AB) | authorized | must | owner |
| U15 | C1, C4 | Inbox stays retired; Sessions owns message/attention delivery; this slice delivers the capability (ingest, store, query) and the Sessions pane UI follows in a later slice. | E-SPEC (retirement shipped), E-OWNER (G) | authorized | must | owner |
| U16 | C2 | Self-pane actions need no grant; cross-pane or workspace-wide actions require an explicit grant, and in round 1 no grant is issuable — such requests fail with a stable missing-grant outcome naming the scope. Same-UID trust is the accepted boundary. Undo-eligible close immediately denies the retained shell and closes its leases; Undo restores eligibility for that same retained-shell credential, while discard or expiry revokes it permanently. | E-SPEC (08-03 trust boundary), E-OWNER (A, M, AB) | authorized | must | owner |
| U17 | S1 | The internal fact vocabulary is shaped so an ACP-connected agent later produces the same facts without translation. | agent proposal | advisory | should | agent (needs owner) |
| U18 | S1 | Agent-to-agent messaging (codex-router libraries, ACP) is a secondary phase and not part of this slice. | E-OWNER (I) | authorized (non-goal) | — | owner |
| U19 | C2, C4 | IPC v2 is JSON-RPC 2.0 with a discoverable schema (method list with typed params and results, MCP-like) so the same surface can back an MCP adapter or SDK later; the CLI is generated from that schema. | E-OWNER (J), ipc.md "MCP should be an adapter over the same registry" | authorized | must | owner |
| U20 | C2 | The `agentstudio` CLI exists in this slice, generated from the catalog (decision J, reaffirmed by R after O was superseded); an SDK and a Rust CLI to codex-router standards are later separate work. | E-OWNER (J, O superseded, R) | authorized | must (CLI) / could (SDK, Rust CLI) | owner |
| U22 | C2 | The surface a model touches costs few tokens: plain scalar arguments (no JSON), no hand-typed identifiers, a closed tiny report vocabulary, one-line replies. | E-OWNER (Q) | authorized | must | owner |
| U21 | C1 | No accepted or durably spooled agent message or deliberate agent report is lost across an app restart: the CLI spools eligible notifications while the app is genuinely unreachable and the app admits them after IPC readiness marked as late, without delaying normal launch. Commands (controls, queries, auth) and authentication-rejected notifications are never buffered offline. A continuing shell in AB's accepted non-durable credential window fails explicitly until a new shell rather than receiving a false accepted/queued receipt. | E-OWNER (K, U, X, AA, AB), E-ORCA | authorized | must | owner |
| U24 | C1, C2 | Normal IDE startup, genuine new terminal creation, and restoration/attachment to an existing zmx shell remain usable without waiting for IPC communication, credential persistence, Sessions/IPC schema readiness, socket/catalog publication or spool work. Restoration performs no credential replacement or IPC/storage readiness read. Any IPC-side failure leaves the IDE and terminal usable and reports the integration unavailable. | E-OWNER (AA, AC), E-IPC (current terminal and boot call paths) | authorized | must | owner |

## User-job sequence inputs (C1, C2)

- C2: agent starts in a pane → reads its environment → runs the skill's
  guard → opens a file in its drawer / reports status / sends a message →
  keeps working. Pain today: none of this is possible; the agent prints paths
  and the user copies them (U1, U2, U3, U8).
- C1: starts three agents → leaves → an agent asks a question → Agent Studio
  records needs-you with a request id → user returns, sees it in Sessions,
  answers in the pane (U7, U13); later slices let them answer from Sessions.
- C3: runs one install → each provider's config gains the Agent Studio hooks
  → uninstall removes exactly those entries (U5, U6).
