# Contributor License Agreement

## Agent Studio — Individual CLA

Thank you for contributing to Agent Studio. This lightweight CLA ensures we can maintain, distribute, and license the project while preserving your rights as a contributor.

### What You Agree To

By submitting a pull request or otherwise contributing to this repository, you agree to the following:

**1. License Grant**

You grant to Shravan Sunder and to recipients of software distributed as Agent Studio a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, and sublicense your contributions — including the right to sublicense under any license, including proprietary licenses.

You retain full copyright ownership of your contributions.

**2. Patent Grant**

You grant to Shravan Sunder and to recipients of software distributed as Agent Studio a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer your contributions, where such license applies only to patents you own or have the right to license.

**3. Representations**

You represent that:
- The contribution is your original work
- You have the right to submit it under these terms
- Your contribution does not violate any third-party intellectual property rights
- If your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have obtained permission to make this contribution or your employer has waived such rights

**4. No Warranty**

You provide your contributions on an "AS IS" basis, without warranties of any kind.

### How to Sign

The CLA is accepted automatically when you submit a pull request.

The PR template includes a "Contributor License Agreement" section at the bottom. **Do not remove or modify that section.** Keeping it intact when you open a PR constitutes your full agreement to these terms.

One agreement covers all future contributions from the same GitHub account. You do not need to sign again for subsequent PRs.

### Dual Licensing Notice

Agent Studio is licensed under AGPL-3.0. The project maintainer reserves the right to offer the software under additional commercial licenses. This CLA enables that through the sublicensing rights granted above. Contributors always retain full copyright ownership and can use their own contributions for any purpose.
